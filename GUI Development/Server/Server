    The "handle()" method of this class is used to

    serialized(pickled) array.  This array will always
    contain a command in index "0" of the array.  Most
    of the time it will also contain the user
    who is operating the client in index "1". The rest
    of the array may be filled with various things like
    arguments, objects and other things.

    for that "messageCode" so that the server responds
    correctly
